# Differentially-Expressed-Genes-in-Breast-Cancer-
Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, with different subtypes exhibiting unique gene expression patterns. Understanding these patterns is crucial for identifying biomarkers and developing targeted therapies. 

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease classified into distinct molecular subtypes, each with unique gene expression patterns. This study employs RNA-Seq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across breast cancer subtypes. By leveraging bioinformatics techniques, we aim to pinpoint potential biomarkers that can enhance diagnostic precision and targeted therapy. Our findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in precision oncology and may aid in the development of more effective breast cancer treatments.

Methods

Data Collection & Preprocessing

RNA-Seq datasets were obtained from publicly available repositories.

Data quality control was performed using FastQC.

Alignment and quantification were conducted using STAR and featureCounts.

Normalization and differential expression analysis were performed using DESeq2.

Bioinformatics Analysis

Volcano plots and principal component analysis (PCA) were generated to visualize gene expression variations.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on an adjusted p-value < 0.05.

Subtype-specific classification was performed by comparing DEGs with known breast cancer subtype markers.
